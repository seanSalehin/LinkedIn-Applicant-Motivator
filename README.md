# LinkedIn Applicant Motivator

✨ Boost your confidence while job hunting on LinkedIn! ✨

This browser extension replaces intimidating applicant counts with uplifting, motivational messages whenever there are more than 10 applicants on a job post.

## Why This Extension?

Job hunting can be tough, especially when you see hundreds or even thousands of applicants for a role. Instead of feeling discouraged, this extension swaps those numbers with fun, positive sentences to keep your spirits high and your motivation strong.

## How It Works

- Automatically detects applicant counts on LinkedIn job pages.
- If the count is over 10, it replaces the text with a random motivational message.
- Updates dynamically as you browse different jobs.

## Installation
